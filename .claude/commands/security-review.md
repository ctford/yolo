# Security Review for YOLO Mode Container

You are a security expert conducting a comprehensive security audit of the YOLO mode container environment. This container is designed for AI-assisted development with controlled risk.

## Your Task

Perform a thorough security review of the container configuration and provide a detailed assessment with actionable recommendations.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Container Configuration Analysis
Examine `/workspace/yolo.sh` and report on:
- Docker security options (`--security-opt`, `--cap-drop`, `--cap-add`, `--read-only`)
- User permissions and sudo access
- Filesystem mounts and isolation
- Tmpfs configurations
- Resource limits (memory, CPU, PIDs)
- Network configuration

### 2. Permission Settings Review
Examine `/workspace/.claude/settings.local.json` and assess:
- Whitelist of allowed operations
- Access to sensitive system paths (/root, /proc, /etc)
- Bash command permissions
- File read/write permissions
- Potential for privilege escalation

### 3. Runtime Security Checks
Execute the following checks inside the container:

```bash
# Check current user and groups
id
groups

# Check sudo access
sudo -l

# Check Linux capabilities
capsh --print

# Check if running in container
cat /proc/1/cgroup | grep -i docker

# Check mount points and filesystem options
mount | grep -E '(workspace|tmp)'

# Check environment variables for sensitive data
env | grep -i key

# Check for security modules
cat /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope 2>/dev/null
```

### 4. Documentation vs Implementation Gap Analysis
Compare documented security features (README.md) against actual implementation:
- Claims about capability dropping
- Claims about read-only filesystem
- Claims about resource limits
- Claims about network restrictions

### 5. API Key Security
Assess:
- How ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is passed and stored
- Visibility to processes
- Risk of exposure or logging
- Permission settings allowing echo of API key

### 6. Risk Assessment

Categorize findings by severity:

**CRITICAL**: Issues that could compromise host system or lead to data exfiltration
**HIGH**: Issues that significantly weaken container security posture
**MEDIUM**: Issues that violate security best practices
**LOW**: Recommendations for defense-in-depth

### 7. Specific YOLO Mode Concerns

Evaluate the risk of:
- Passwordless sudo combined with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` mode
- AI agent having root-equivalent access inside container
- Potential for malicious package installation
- Code execution risks
- Data exfiltration through network access

**Important**: Be thorough but practical. The goal is "responsible YOLO coding" - balancing experimentation freedom with appropriate boundaries. Focus on host system protection as the primary security boundary, while identifying container-internal risks that could be exploited.
